            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The ICCCN 2024 workshop, titled 'Big Data Driven Secure and Smart Future Networks', serves as a call to action for experts, scholars, and professionals to tackle the emerging security and intelligence challenges brought by the advent of big data. Supported by big data analytics and AI, future networks are evolving towards a deterministic model, prioritizing instantaneous and reliable communication in areas such as 6G, industrial automation, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. To address these challenges, it is essential to ensure reliable low-latency communications, maintain process accuracy, and provide support for real-time applications. Simultaneously, challenges in the broad scope of big data include maintaining data quality, interpreting complex models, and managing intricate data. Navigating these complexities effectively requires the development of innovative solutions and strategic approaches. The immense scale and complexity of big data pose risks to data privacy, broaden the attack surface, and increase sophisticated cyber threats, thus jeopardizing data integrity. The insufficiency of traditional security strategies, given the complexities of data privacy laws and the increased risk of breaches, highlights the critical importance of security. This workshop emphasizes the urgent need to develop advanced security measures and intelligence solutions that leverage the capabilities of big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to create more intelligent and secure future networks.</p>
